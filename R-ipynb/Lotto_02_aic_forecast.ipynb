    "### 1) (size: 56) This study is NOT just about the model accuracy and prediction, BUT also the selection process for new estimates. We MUST identify ANY deficiency in the current models, compare them with new prospective models, and understand WHY one model is \"better\" than another. Also, preference is given to the application, analysis and synthesis that are difficult to perform using the Shiny package.\n",
    "### 1.1) (size: 7) I do NOT quite understand why a diff.arima model is \"better\" at predicting than a log.diff.arima model. By \"better\", I mean TWO (2) things: (a) confidence intervals are tighter; (b) actual results lie within confidence intervals.\n",
    "### 1.2) (size: 37) Also, we MUST size up, weigh and value EACH number in an estimate. We should determine if the size, weight OR value of a number has changed with respective to predicted estimates and actual results. \n",
    "### 1.3) (size: 56) Historically, some plots would make the data more interesting: (i) the actual number vs confidence interval should be plotted for past number of draws."
