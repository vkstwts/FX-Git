    "### 1.1) (size: ) There are TWO (2) elements that are required: (a) text to be classified; and (b) manually-coded classification (topic). For example, a breast cancer is classified as EITHER benign (2) OR active (4)."

    "### 1.1.1) (size: ) First load the data file, if exists. Otherwise, we call the function jobEfcUpdateNum(). \n",
    "### 1.1.2) The function jobEfcUpdateNum() scrapes the relevant job details from the web page and appends the data into am existing CSV file (OR creates a new CSV file, if it does NOT exist). The most important parameter is sectorStr - a string to specify EITHER \"Accounting_Finance\", \"Asset_Management\", \"Capital_Markets\", \"Commodities\", \"Equities\", \"FX_Money_Markets\", \"Hedge_Funds\", \"Quantitative_Analytics\", \"Research\", OR \"Trading\".\n",
    "### 1.1.3) The raw data contains the first element, i.e. text to be classified, in the column \"content\". However, the second element has to be MANUALLY encoded, as a new column \"topic\". It is unclear whether topic should be either: (a) a binary outcome; OR (b) a discrete outcome. As it is easier to reduce the outcome later, we select topic to be a discrete outcome. \n",
    "### 1.1.4) The discrete outcome \"topic\" has the following values: (i) 0000 - NA; (ii) 0001 - trader; (iii) 0010 - analyst; (iv) 0011 - fund manager; (v) 0100 - sell-side; (vi) 1000 - buy-side; (vii) 01100 - quantitative; (viii) 1101 - technical; (ix) 1110 - fundamental. For example, a proprietary trading based on technical analysis job is 1+8+13=22, while a quantitative sell-side analyst job is 2+4+12=18. It is imperative that ALL possible combinations are unique. However, it is unclear if discrete outcomes with unique combinations yields better results than binary outcome.\n",
    "### 1.1.5) To manually encode: (i) Is it a trader, analyst, fund manager OR other? Add 1, 2, 3 OR 0 respectively; (ii) Is it a sell-side, buy-side OR neither? Add 4, 8 OR 0 respectively; (iii) Is it a quantitative, technical, fundamental OR none? Add 12, 13, 14 OR 0 respectively.\n",
